First do manual flow and then automate it using playwright.Use resilient locators like text,role , label etc .Avoid using brittle locators like xpath,css selectors etc.Use existing PlaywrightProject scaffold in the repo to add the test automation code.Do not use any third party libraries except Playwright and its official plugins.
