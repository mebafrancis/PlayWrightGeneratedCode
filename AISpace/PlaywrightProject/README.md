# PlaywrightProject

This is a small Playwright test project scaffolded for quick start.

How to use:

1. Open a terminal in `c:\Users\melba\js-workspace\AISpace\PlaywrightProject`
2. Install dependencies (optional):

```powershell
npm install
# or to install dev dependency explicitly
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

3. Run tests:

```powershell
npm test
```

Notes:
- I added a simple `example.spec.ts` test that visits https://example.com.
- If you want me to run `npm install` and `npx playwright install` now, tell me and I will run them.
